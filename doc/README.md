1. Customized virtual infrastructures to be deployed on Cloud sites.
2. Jobs to be executed through Chronos on an Apache Mesos cluster.
3. Long-running services to de deployed through Marathon on an Apache Mesos cluster.

Further information on the aforementioned scenarios is available in the  public [deliverable D5.2](https://www.indigo-datacloud.eu/documents/design-document-and-work-plan-paas-architecture-d52).  

If you come from a user community interested in INDIGO-DataCloud, be aware that there is no need to understand TOSCA to use the platform. You can be provided with high-level graphical user interfaces that abstract away all the details.

Instead, this information is provided for power users that may be interested in tinkering with the platform.
